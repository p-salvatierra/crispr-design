CRISPR Basics

Components: Cas enzyme + guide RNA
Target: Unique sequence + adjacent to a PAM
PAM sequence: binding signal for Cas9
Cas9 nuclease domains: RuvC and HNH

General steps:
1. Select target, express gRNA and Cas9 protein
2. Ribonucleoprotein complex forms
3. Cas9 cleaves if gRNA spacer shares sufficient homology with the target DNA
4. After complex binds, seed sequence anneals to the target DNA
5. Mismatches in the 3' seed sequence inhibits target cleavage, mismatches toward the 5' end often permit target cleavage

Generating a Knockout:
1. Cas9 domains cleave opposite strands of target DNA. Results in a DSB, 3-4 nucleotides upstream of PAM sequence
2. Resulting DSB is repaired, but frequently causes small indels. 
> Ideal result is a loss-of-function mutation

Multiplex Genome Engineering
* Delivering multiple gRNAs using a single plasmid

Cas9 Endonuclease Engineering
CRISPR specificity is determined by the gRNA sequence and the Cas9 enzyme

* Off-targets: Sites of partial homology with gRNA throughout the genome
* Cas9 nuclease domains can be altered to reduce cleavage to a single cut or no cuts
